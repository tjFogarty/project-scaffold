Project Scaffold
================

Simple website scaffolding. Makes use of Sass and Grunt with some default tasks  (concat, uglify, imagemin). 
I've attempted to lay out the Sass directories & files to mimic that of [Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

Some other defaults include:

- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Unsemantic](http://unsemantic.com/)
- Some mixins from [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/)
- [jQuery 1.10.2](http://jquery.com/) (for IE8 support)
- [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) (with a default send-mail.php file ready to go)

This is all very likely to change as I learn more :)
